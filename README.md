# AgriHydro
Agriculture and Hydrological assessment model.
AgriHydro consists of 4 components and each of them will be introduced below, which each of them can be used independently.
To run AgriHydro, please follow the steps below.
1. Make sure following folders are prepared
  (1) AgriHydroPYFile		          => python files
	(2) AgriHydroCommonWthData	    => weather data folder
	(3) AgriHydroCommonSDInflowData	=> stream flow data folder
	(4) AgriHydroBlank		          => results and other files
2. Prepare weather data using MultiWG and name the file as [GCM]_ [Rcp]_ [start year(EX 2021)]_ [station ID].csv. Put those weather files in AgriHydroCommonWthData folder.
3. Prepare stream flow using GWLF and name the file as [GCM]_ [Rcp]_ [start year(EX 2021)]_ [Run (EX 1)]_ [year in the Run (EX y11)].csv. Put those stream flow files in AgriHydroCommonSDInflowData folder.
4. Exercute the function, BatchRun, in AgriHydro_A_Batch.py to run AgriHydro
  
## Multi-site Stochastic Weather Generator

The instruction, sample data, and the program can be downloaded at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YCsQCfLnDI2d7cy8DR51DyG--BJSmEf0?usp=sharing.

Currently, we only provide exe file for users. The source code could be provided in the future or by request. Further infomation please contact the author. 

## GWLF model
For this components, user can either run GWLF.py directly from Python or download the EXE version from the link provided in GWLF/GWLF_EXE.txt. Inside the folder we also provide sample input files "Shihmen2008_2017_SampleWthData.csv" & "ShihmenGWLFPar.csv", which represent weather input data and parameter input data respectively. Following the format of sample input files, user can run the GWLF model for their own study area.

## Taoyuan SD model
Here we provide the converted Taoyuan SD model, which can be exercuted by PySD package.
To load the model, the following code can be used.
```
SDmodel = pysd.load(filename)
```
More control options can be found at https://pysd-cookbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

## AquaCrop
The input files for our study crops, such as Rice and Soybean, are provided. For more detail about AquaCrop, please find it at http://www.fao.org/aquacrop.
